# Wave-Interference-Simulation
Wave Interference Simulator is an interactive physics tool that visualizes how two waves combine through constructive and destructive interference. Users can adjust amplitudes, frequencies, and phase difference in real time, watch the resulting wave animation, and explore the fundamentals of wave behavior in a clear, dynamic way.
